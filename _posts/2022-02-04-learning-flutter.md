I created my first Flutter app following this [code lab]
(https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt1/#0)

I did both Part 1 and 2. There is also [YouTube video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6KZ3cTGBWw&list=PLjxrf2q8roU3wk7CDw4RfV3mEwOJbjx1k&index=3) that walks through the tutorial.


The tutorial itself was well explained and easy to follow. It took me some time to set up the Android Studio and the Emulator. 
I had to google some errors along the way.
