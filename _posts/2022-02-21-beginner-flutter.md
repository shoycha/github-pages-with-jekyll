I finished Build Native Mobile Apps with Flutter a free course from Udacity.
[Go to the course](https://https://www.udacity.com/course/build-native-mobile-apps-with-flutter--ud905) 

Although it is relatively short course, it still took me a week to finish it. I learned what stateful and stateless widgets are, 
learn how to customize widgets, how to use assets and make API calls.

I recommend this course for Flutter beginners like me.
